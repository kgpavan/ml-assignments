function idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)
%FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS computes the centroid memberships for every example
%   idx = FINDCLOSESTCENTROIDS (X, centroids) returns the closest centroids
%   in idx for a dataset X where each row is a single example. idx = m x 1 
%   vector of centroid assignments (i.e. each entry in range [1..K])
%

% Set K
K = size(centroids, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
idx = zeros(size(X,1), 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
%               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
%               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
%               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
%               range 1..K
%
% Note: You can use a for-loop over the examples to compute this.
%

N = size(X,2);	


for i=1:length(X)
	for k=1:K		
		for n=1:N	
			a(n)=(X(i,n)-centroids(k,n)).^2;	% Calc distance from X to centroids (sum to N, not just 2)
		end
		dist(k)=sum(a);		% Distance from point X to centroids 
	end
	[r,c] = min(dist);		% Find the index of the min distance btw X and centroids
	idx(i) = c;				% Assign for each X which centroid it belongs to
end
